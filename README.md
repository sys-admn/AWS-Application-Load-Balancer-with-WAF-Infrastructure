# 🚀 AWS Application Load Balancer with WAF Infrastructure

This Terraform project deploys a comprehensive AWS infrastructure featuring:
- VPC with public and private subnets
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Auto Scaling Group for EC2 instances
- Bastion host for secure SSH access
- CloudWatch monitoring and alerting
- Centralized logging with S3 storage
- VPC Flow Logs for network traffic analysis

## 📋 Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](/assets/png/Development%20eu-west-3.png)

The infrastructure consists of:

1. **VPC Layer**:
   - Public and private subnets across multiple AZs
   - NAT Gateway for outbound internet access from private subnets
   - Internet Gateway for inbound/outbound access in public subnets
   - VPC Flow Logs for network traffic monitoring and security analysis

2. **Security Layer**:
   - WAF to protect against common web exploits
   - Security groups for fine-grained access control
   - Bastion host for secure SSH access to instances
   - Geographic restrictions for traffic filtering
   - Network traffic monitoring with VPC Flow Logs

3. **Application Layer**:
   - ALB to distribute traffic to web servers
   - Auto Scaling Group to maintain application availability
   - EC2 instances running web servers

4. **Monitoring & Logging Layer**:
   - CloudWatch dashboards for infrastructure visibility
   - CloudWatch alarms for automated notifications
   - SNS topics for alert delivery
   - Centralized logging to S3 with lifecycle policies
   - Log analysis dashboards
   - VPC Flow Logs analysis and visualization

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Terraform v1.8+
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- SSH key pair for EC2 instance access

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

### Using Terraform Workspaces

```bash
# Create and select the development workspace
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace select dev

# Create and select the production workspace
terraform workspace new prod
terraform workspace select prod
```

### Development Environment

```bash
# Select the development workspace
terraform workspace select dev

# Plan the deployment
terraform plan -var-file="dev.tfvars"

# Apply the changes
terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars"
```

### Production Environment

```bash
# Select the production workspace
terraform workspace select prod

# Plan the deployment
terraform plan -var-file="prod.tfvars"

# Apply the changes
terraform apply -var-file="prod.tfvars"
```

### Destroy Resources

```bash
# When you're done, destroy the resources
terraform workspace select dev
terraform destroy -var-file="dev.tfvars"

# Or for production
terraform workspace select prod
terraform destroy -var-file="prod.tfvars"
```

## 🔒 Security Features

- WAF protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- IP-based access restrictions for bastion host
- Security groups with least privilege access
- Private subnets for application servers
- HTTPS support with custom SSL certificates
- Geographic restrictions for traffic filtering
- Encrypted logs storage
- VPC Flow Logs for network traffic monitoring and security analysis

## 📊 Monitoring and Alerting

- CloudWatch dashboard for infrastructure metrics
- Automated alerts for:
  - High CPU utilization
  - ALB 5XX errors
  - WAF blocked requests
  - Abnormal log volume
  - Suspicious network traffic patterns (via Flow Logs)
  - Rejected network traffic exceeding thresholds

## 📝 Logging System

The infrastructure includes a comprehensive logging system with the following features:

- **Centralized Log Storage**:
  - S3 bucket for long-term log storage
  - CloudWatch Log Groups for real-time log analysis
  - Automatic log rotation and lifecycle management

- **Log Lifecycle Management**:
  - Transition to IA storage class after 30 days (configurable)
  - Transition to Glacier storage after 90 days (configurable)
  - Automatic expiration after 365 days (configurable)

- **Log Sources**:
  - EC2 instance system logs
  - Application logs (Apache, etc.)
  - WAF logs for security analysis
  - ALB access logs
  - VPC Flow Logs for network traffic analysis

- **Log Analysis**:
  - CloudWatch Logs Insights for querying logs
  - Custom CloudWatch dashboard for log visualization
  - Metrics based on log data
  - Network traffic pattern analysis

- **Security**:
  - Encrypted log storage
  - Access control via IAM
  - Redaction of sensitive information

## 🔍 VPC Flow Logs

The infrastructure includes VPC Flow Logs for network traffic monitoring:

- **Traffic Visibility**: Capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC
- **Security Analysis**: Identify suspicious traffic patterns and potential security threats
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for network monitoring and auditing
- **Troubleshooting**: Diagnose overly restrictive security group rules or network ACLs
- **Visualization**: Custom CloudWatch dashboard for Flow Logs analysis
- **Alerting**: Automated alerts for abnormal network traffic patterns

## 🔄 Auto Scaling

The EC2 instances are managed by an Auto Scaling Group that:
- Maintains a minimum number of instances
- Scales based on CPU utilization
- Distributes instances across availability zones

## 📝 Customization

Edit the `.tfvars` files to customize:
- VPC CIDR and subnet configuration
- Instance types and sizes
- Auto Scaling parameters
- WAF rules and protections
- Monitoring thresholds
- Log retention policies
- Flow Logs configuration

### Important Configuration Notes

When setting up your environment, you'll need to configure:

1. **SNS Topic for Alerts**: 
   - Create an SNS topic in your AWS account
   - Update the `sns_topic_arn` variable in your tfvars files with your SNS topic ARN
   - Example format: `arn:aws:sns:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:TOPIC_NAME`

2. **SSL Certificate for HTTPS (Production)**:
   - For production, create or import an SSL certificate in AWS Certificate Manager
   - Update the `certificate_arn` variable in prod.tfvars with your certificate ARN

3. **IP Restrictions**:
   - Update `bastion_allowed_ips` with your organization's IP addresses
   - Update `waf_blocked_ips` with any IPs you want to block
